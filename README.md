# Event-Driven System with RabbitMQ

This project implements an **event-driven system** using **RabbitMQ** as the message broker. It follows **Clean Architecture** principles and utilizes **publishers and consumers** to handle different event types asynchronously.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **3 Publishers** for `type1` events (fixed interval of 3s)
- **1 Publisher** for `type2` (random interval)
- **1 Publisher** for `type3` (random interval)
- **2 Consumers** for `type1` events
- **1 Consumer** for `type2` events
- **1 Consumer** for `type3` events (which triggers a `type4` event)
- **1 Consumer** for `type4` events
- **Logging** for all operations
